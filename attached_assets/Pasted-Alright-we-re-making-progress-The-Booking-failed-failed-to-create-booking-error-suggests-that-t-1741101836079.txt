Alright, we’re making progress! The “Booking failed, failed to create booking” error suggests that the backend is unable to store the booking in the database. This could be caused by:
	1.	Database Schema Issues
	•	The booking data structure might not match what the backend is trying to insert.
	•	If we recently added appointment time & service details, but the schema wasn’t updated properly, it could be rejecting the request.
	2.	Backend Route Issue (server/routes.ts)
	•	The API route handling booking creation might have an issue, either in:
	•	Parsing incoming data from the frontend.
	•	Storing the data in the database.
	•	Returning a success response.
	3.	Frontend Not Sending Proper Data
	•	The booking wizard might not be sending all required fields in the request.
	•	If appointment time or selected services aren’t formatted properly, the backend could reject the request.

Before Prompting Replit Assistant, Check These:

1. Open the Console for More Error Details
	•	Check if the backend logs show a more detailed error.
	•	If possible, share any specific errors from the server logs.

2. Look at the Booking API Route (server/routes.ts)
	•	Find the function handling POST /create-booking (or similar).
	•	Look for any required fields that might be missing (like appointment time or service details).

3. Open the Network Tab in Developer Tools
	•	In your browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox):
	1.	Open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect).
	2.	Go to the Network tab.
	3.	Try to book an appointment.
	4.	Click on the failed request and check the payload (sent data) and response (error message from server).

Now, Use This Prompt for Replit Assistant:

“I’m getting a booking failure error:

Booking failed, failed to create booking

	1.	Fix Booking Data Storage in the Database
	•	Ensure all booking details (selected services, appointment time, total price, customer info) are properly inserted into the database.
	•	If necessary, update the database schema to match the booking structure.
	2.	Fix Backend API (server/routes.ts)
	•	Make sure the booking route properly parses and stores all required fields.
	•	Handle missing fields correctly and return clear error messages.
	3.	Ensure the Frontend Sends Complete Booking Data
	•	The booking wizard must send all selected services, total price, and appointment time in the request.
	•	Fix any incorrect request formatting.

Please fix this ASAP while ensuring that nothing else breaks.”

After the Fix, Test These Again:

✅ Try booking again and see if it succeeds.
✅ If it fails, check the exact error message in the Console or Network tab.
✅ Verify that the database now stores all booking details correctly.
