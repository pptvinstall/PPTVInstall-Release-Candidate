New Feature & Site Improvements for Picture Perfect TV Install

Now that everything is running smoothly, let’s add a robust new feature, improve service selection, and enhance the customer journey (which is called User Flow).

Feature #1: Dynamic Availability & Scheduling System

Right now, customers can book anytime, but we need to ensure:
✅ They can only book within business hours (or adjusted hours if needed).
✅ We can block off time manually (for days off, booked slots, or breaks).
✅ The booking system updates automatically as customers book appointments.

Options for Implementation:
	1.	Option 1: Embed a Scheduling App
	•	Use Calendly, Setmore, or SimplyBook.me for a real-time booking system.
	•	Allows easy time blocking & availability control.
	•	Syncs with Google Calendar to auto-update availability.
	•	Customers only see available time slots based on our schedule.
	•	Best if you want a quick solution.
	2.	Option 2: Build a Custom Calendar System (More Control)
	•	Custom database-driven calendar that updates based on customer bookings.
	•	Allows manual blocking of time directly from the site.
	•	Could sync with Google Calendar if needed.
	•	Best if you want full control without relying on third-party services.

Final Decision

🔹 Fastest & easiest solution? → Embed Calendly, Setmore, or SimplyBook.me.
🔹 More control & future-proofing? → Custom availability system with manual blocking.

Feature #2: Expand Services & Improve Customer Flow

Right now, we list the services, but we can upgrade this by:
✅ Adding more service options & descriptions (e.g., Soundbar Mounting, Full Home Theater Setup, Custom Wire Concealment).
✅ Improving service selection flow so customers understand what they need before booking.
✅ Adding a “Guided Selection” system where customers answer quick questions to determine the best service for them.

Ways to Improve User Flow (Customer Journey)

Right now, customers land on the site and book a service, but let’s make it even smoother by:
✅ Adding a Step-by-Step Service Selection Wizard (Example: “What size is your TV?” → “Where do you want it mounted?” → “Do you need a mount included?” → Suggested service appears.)
✅ Rearranging the Homepage CTA buttons to highlight important actions first (e.g., Booking, Contact, Learn More).
✅ Improving the FAQ page with interactive Q&A sections.
✅ Making the checkout process clearer if deposits are involved.
