Prompt for Replit (Bolt.new):

*“I need to completely overhaul my existing Picture Perfect TV Install booking system to create a more fluid and user-friendly experience based on my updated pricing list (provided below). This should be built as a web app with a clean, intuitive booking flow where customers can easily select services, see live pricing updates, and book appointments.

Key Updates & Requirements:
	1.	Pricing Updates
	•	Use the latest pricing list provided below.
	•	No deposit required at the time of booking—full payment is made upon service completion.
	2.	Dynamic Booking Flow
	•	Customers can select multiple services (TV mounting, outlet installation, smart home setup, general labor, etc.), and pricing updates in real-time.
	•	Discounts for additional TVs or outlets should be automatically applied.
	•	Travel fees should only appear if the customer’s address is more than 30 minutes away.
	3.	Interactive Selection Process
	•	Customers choose TV size, number of TVs, wall type (drywall, masonry, fireplace, etc.), and any add-ons.
	•	System automatically adjusts pricing based on selections.
	•	If a fireplace is selected, the system warns customers that additional pictures may be needed for outlet relocation.
	4.	Smart Calendar Integration
	•	Sync with Google Calendar to prevent overbooking.
	•	Show only available time slots for booking.
	•	Once a booking is confirmed, send email confirmation to both me (business owner) and the customer.
	•	Booking details should include the selected services and total cost.
	5.	Enhanced Customer Experience
	•	Customers should never see unnecessary options (e.g., wire concealment shouldn’t appear for fireplace installs).
	•	The UI should guide users step-by-step through the selection process.
	•	Provide a clear breakdown of services & pricing before finalizing the booking.
	6.	Backend Functionality
	•	Store customer bookings in a database (SQL or Firebase preferred).
	•	If Google Calendar sync is unreliable, store appointments internally and delete the earliest booking when full.
	•	Ensure all necessary data (customer info, service selections, total cost, appointment time) is properly logged.
	7.	No Deposit Requirement
	•	Remove the previous 30% deposit requirement.
	•	Final payment is made after service completion via cash, Zelle, or Apple Pay.
