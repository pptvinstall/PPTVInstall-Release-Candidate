Replit Prompt for Upgrading Booking Confirmation & Continuous Site Improvements

Now that the booking system is working and emails are sending successfully, let’s refine the customer confirmation message to match the branding and feel of the site. Additionally, we want Replit to keep improving the site with new features and optimizations over time.

Prompt for Replit: Upgrade Booking Confirmation & Ongoing Site Enhancements

*“Improve the customer booking confirmation email to match the branding and professional feel of the Picture Perfect TV Install website. Ensure that the message reflects the same design and tone as the site and includes all necessary booking details.
