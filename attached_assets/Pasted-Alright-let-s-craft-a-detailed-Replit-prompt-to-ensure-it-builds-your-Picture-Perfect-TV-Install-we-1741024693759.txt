Development Priorities
	1.	All backend functions (email, booking, payments) must be fully integrated into the site UI.
	2.	Keep the frontend lightweight and optimized for performance.
	3.	If direct embedding isn‚Äôt possible, design the UI around external tools to maintain a seamless experience.
	4.	Ensure smooth mobile responsiveness and cross-device compatibility.
	5.	Deploy on Replit Hosting (or Netlify if preferred).

Deployment & Next Steps
	1.	Start a new Replit project (Flask or Express).
	2.	Build the frontend structure and test booking/email functionality.
	3.	Integrate Google SMTP for the contact form.
	4.	Ensure the booking system embeds smoothly into the site.
