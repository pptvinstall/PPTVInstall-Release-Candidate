Since the current approach is **causing multiple errors** and the `googleapis` library is **not designed for direct browser use**, we should **switch to a more reliable approach** instead of forcing a fix.  

### **ðŸš€ Best Alternative Approach**
The best way to handle Google Calendar integration **without running into browser limitations** is to:

1. **Move Google Calendar API calls to the server-side**  
   - Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/calendar/availability`) that will handle availability checks.  
   - This keeps the **Google API key secure** and avoids browser compatibility issues.

2. **Have the client (booking system) fetch data from this new endpoint**  
   - The frontend will request availability **from the backend** instead of calling Google Calendar directly.  

3. **Use Google Calendarâ€™s official browser-compatible client libraries (if needed)**  
   - If we still want to handle availability on the client side, we should use Google's official browser-friendly libraries **instead of `googleapis`**.

### **âœ… Response to Replit:**  
*"The Google Calendar API integration isn't working properly because `googleapis` is designed for Node.js, not browsers. Instead of trying to fix the polyfill errors, let's switch to a **more reliable approach**:  

1. **Move Google Calendar API calls to the server-side**  
   - Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/api/calendar/availability`) that handles availability checks.  

2. **Have the frontend fetch data from this new API**  
   - The client should request available time slots from our backend instead of calling Google Calendar directly.  

3. **If needed, use Google Calendarâ€™s browser-compatible client libraries** instead of `googleapis`.  

Let's apply this new approach so the integration works properly without browser limitations."*

### **ðŸ“Œ Next Steps**
1. **Replit should switch to the backend API approach.**  
2. **Once implemented, test again to see if availability updates correctly.**  
3. **If there are still issues, we can embed the `<iframe>` as a backup.**  

This should **fix the errors and make real-time availability work smoothly!** Let me know when Replit applies the changes. ðŸš€
