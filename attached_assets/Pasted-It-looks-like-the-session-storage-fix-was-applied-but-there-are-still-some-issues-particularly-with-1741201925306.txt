It looks like the session storage fix was applied, but there are still some issues—particularly with data retrieval and a missing dependency (react-router-dom).

⸻

🚨 Key Issues Still Present
	1.	“Booking Not Found” Error on the Confirmation Page
	•	This suggests the booking data isn’t being stored or retrieved correctly.
	•	The system may not be passing the booking ID properly or failing to pull session data on page load.
	2.	“Failed to resolve import ‘react-router-dom’”
	•	This error means a required dependency is missing or not properly installed.
	•	Without react-router-dom, the app can’t handle navigation or pass URL parameters correctly.

⸻

🔄 New Fix Approach

Since this keeps happening, let’s replace any unreliable methods with simpler, more reliable solutions:

1️⃣ Ensure Booking Data is Properly Stored and Retrieved
	•	Instead of relying on session storage only, store booking details in a temporary backend database or local storage.
	•	If using session storage, make sure the data persists correctly across page reloads.

🛠 New Fix for Replit:
“Ensure booking data is properly stored and retrieved by either using a temporary backend database or fixing session storage persistence. Make sure the booking ID is always available when the confirmation page loads.”

2️⃣ Fix the “react-router-dom” Missing Dependency
	•	If react-router-dom is missing, it must be reinstalled for routing and navigation to work.
	•	Run:

npm install react-router-dom


	•	Then restart the app to ensure all imports work properly.

🛠 New Fix for Replit:
“Fix the missing ‘react-router-dom’ dependency by reinstalling it and ensuring all routes and imports work correctly to pass booking data between pages.”

⸻

🚀 Next Steps
	1.	Submit these fixes to Replit to resolve the broken booking confirmation page and routing issue.
	2.	Once fixed, test again to confirm:
	•	The selected time appears correctly.
	•	The booking details are stored and retrieved properly.
	•	The confirmation page loads without missing data.

This should finally stabilize the booking system and eliminate recurring issues. Let me know once it’s applied!
