Thanks for sending the full booking flow! Here’s my breakdown of what’s working, what needs fixing, and how we can enhance the experience for clarity and better flow.

⸻

✅ What’s Working Well
	1.	Service Selection & Customization – Customers can easily add TV mounting and smart home installations, select sizes, mounting locations, and other details.
	2.	Clear Price Breakdown – Price updates dynamically based on selections, which helps customers see the final cost upfront.
	3.	Calendar & Time Selection – The date/time picker is intuitive and lets customers choose an available slot.
	4.	Final Booking Summary – The confirmation page clearly summarizes the selected services, appointment time, and price.

⚠️ Issues That Need Fixing

1. Booking Confirmation Time is Incorrect
	•	You selected 7:30 PM, but the confirmation page shows 11:30 PM.
	•	Fix: Ensure the timezone conversion is correct and the displayed time matches what the customer selected.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Fix the timezone issue on the booking confirmation page so that the displayed appointment time exactly matches the time selected by the user during booking, ensuring correct local time formatting.”

⸻

2. The “Confirm Selection” and “Next” Buttons are Still Separate
	•	These should be merged so that Confirm Selection automatically moves to the next step.
	•	This avoids confusion and extra clicks.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Merge the ‘Confirm Selection’ and ‘Next’ buttons into a single button that confirms the selection and automatically moves to the next step. Ensure selections are saved before proceeding.”

🛠 Enhancements for a Better Flow & Customer Clarity

3. Step 1 – “Add TV Installation” Button is Too Generic
	•	Instead of “+ Add TV Installation”, make it more descriptive like:
“Add a TV to Mount” or “Select TV Size & Mounting Location”
	•	This way, customers immediately know what they’re adding instead of just clicking a generic “+ Add TV Installation” button.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Update the ‘Add TV Installation’ button text to be more descriptive, such as ‘Add a TV to Mount’ or ‘Select TV Size & Mounting Location’ for better clarity.”

⸻

4. Step 2 – Mounting Height Clarification
	•	The Smart Camera Installation step says:
”+$25 per additional 4 feet above 8 feet”
	•	Customers might not immediately understand how height affects the price.
	•	Solution: Add a small info icon (ℹ️) or a tooltip that explains how the pricing works.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Add a tooltip or info icon next to the Smart Camera mount height pricing to clarify how extra height affects the price.”

⸻

5. Step 3 – Booking Review Page Could Highlight Key Info More Clearly
	•	The review page is well-structured but could use slight formatting improvements to emphasize the most important details:
	•	Make the selected appointment time more prominent (bold + slightly larger font).
	•	Highlight the total price clearly so it’s easy to verify before booking.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Enhance the Booking Review page by making the selected appointment time and total price more visually prominent for easy customer verification.”

⸻

6. Step 4 – “What Happens Next?” Section Could Provide More Reassurance
	•	Right now, it says: “One of our installation specialists will contact you before your scheduled appointment.”
	•	This is good, but customers might wonder:
	•	How soon will they be contacted? (e.g., within 24 hours?)
	•	What should they prepare? (e.g., make sure they have a mount, clear space, etc.)
	•	Solution: Add a few extra clarification points to avoid customer uncertainty.

🔹 Prompt for Replit:
“Expand the ‘What Happens Next?’ section with details on when customers will be contacted and any preparation steps they should take before installation.”
