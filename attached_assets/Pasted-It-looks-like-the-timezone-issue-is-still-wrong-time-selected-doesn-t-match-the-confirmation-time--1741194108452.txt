It looks like the timezone issue is still wrong (time selected doesn’t match the confirmation time), and the Confirm Selection and Next buttons are still separate. Since these fixes have been attempted multiple times, it’s time to step back and find a different approach instead of repeating the same process.

🔄 New Approach to Solve These Issues

Instead of making small adjustments, let’s simplify how these features work at a foundational level.

1️⃣ Fix the Timezone Issue (Alternative Approach)
	•	Instead of converting time between different time zones, we should store and display the exact time the user selects without modification.
	•	If conversion is necessary, store the time in UTC but always display it in Eastern Time (ET).

🛠 New Fix for Replit:
“Change the way appointment times are handled by storing and displaying the exact time selected by the user without any conversion. If timezone adjustments are required, store the time in UTC but always display it in Eastern Time (ET) to ensure consistency.”

2️⃣ Merge the Confirm Selection & Next Buttons (Alternative Approach)

Instead of trying to merge two existing buttons, we should remove the need for “Confirm Selection” entirely and make selections auto-save.
	•	Solution: When a user makes a selection, it should be automatically saved without needing to press Confirm Selection.
	•	The “Next” button should simply move forward because the selection is already stored.

🛠 New Fix for Replit:
“Remove the need for ‘Confirm Selection’ by making selections auto-save as soon as they are chosen. The ‘Next’ button should simply move forward without requiring an extra confirmation step.”

Next Steps
	1.	Submit this new approach to Replit so it stops tweaking the same issues repeatedly.
	2.	Once the fixes are applied, test again to make sure the time is displayed correctly and that the booking flow is smoother.

This should simplify everything, reducing errors and making the process more intuitive. Let me know once it’s applied!
