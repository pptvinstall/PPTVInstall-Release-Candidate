## 🚀 Final Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Klaviyo Private API Key

1. **Login to Klaviyo**: Go to [klaviyo.com](https://klaviyo.com) and sign in
2. **Navigate to API Keys**: Account → Settings → API Keys
3. **Create Private API Key**:

   - Name it: "Website Booking Integration"
   - Select these scopes:
     - ✅ **Profiles:Write** (required for creating customer profiles)
     - ✅ **Profiles:Read** (optional, for future features)

### Step 2: Configure the API Key

**Replace this line in `/server/routes.ts` (around line 1095):**

```typescript
'Authorization': `Klaviyo-API-Key pk_live_YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY_HERE`, // Replace with actual private key
```

**With your actual private key:**

```typescript
'Authorization': `Klaviyo-API-Key pk_live_ABCD1234567890`, // Your actual private key
```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Make a test booking** through your website
2. **Check Klaviyo dashboard**: Profiles → All Profiles

## 🎯 Marketing Automation Ideas

Now that customers are automatically added to Klaviyo, you can create:

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Integration Status

### Important Notes
- **Booking won't fail** if Klaviyo is down - it's fail-safe
- **All booking data** is still saved to your database
- **Email confirmations** still send normally
- **Klaviyo errors** are logged but don't break the booking flow
